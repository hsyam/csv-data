# CSV Files Parser

CLI tool for this solving problem,

There is a csv file that keeps a record of n order details for orders made at an online

shopping website. The file has a .csv extension.

Each line contains a single record with the following columns, in order:

* Id of the order placed

* Area where the order was delivered

* Name of the product

* Quantity of the product delivered in that order

* Brand of the ordered product

  

Create two csv files named 0_input_file_name and 1_input_file_name where input_file_name

is the name of the input file given in the input including the .csv extension. Each file must

contain r rows where r is the number of distinct products. Data should be comma delimited,

and the row order does not matter.

  

The structure of each file is as follows:

* 0_input_file_name - In the first column, list the product Name. The second column should contain the average quantity of the product purchased per order.

  

* 1_input_file_name - In the first column, list the product Name. The second column should be the most popular Brand for that product. Most popular is defined as the brand with the most total orders for the item, not the quantity purchased. If two or more brands have the same popularity for a product, include any one.
